# 🙋🏻PPT Gesture Control

#### 📑Tasks
* Come up with some natural non-awkward hand movement to control the interface
* Code it (MediaPipe Solution by Google)
  * Gesture to key mapping for: up, down, right, left, enter...
  * Volume control 
* Setup a stream to the code through Google meet window
  * On the stage, a smartphone camera would stream on a google meet. The host PC would be participant of the meet and would get the stream data thereby.
* Test and optimize sensitivity and feasibility on stage.
  * We need the API to be low latency and to suppress false moves.
* Integrate simple tkinter gui 

#### 🛠️Setup
```
Windows
1. python -m venv ppt_control_env
2. ./ppt_control_env/Scripts/activate

4. python3 run.py
5. deactivate
```

#### 📦Final Packaging
```
$> pip freeze > requirements.txt <br>
$> pyinstaller --onefile --windowed <i>filename</i>.py
```

#### 🎶Notes
* Some initial unstructured, not so well designed files have been dumped into the repository which work (They are of TRS itself and not from internet). They are for shear understanding of the general implementation logic and not a development model for us. Refrain from following similar structuring.  
* Communicate any concerns and enhancements with the maintainers.
